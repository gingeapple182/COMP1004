# COMP1004

aim to create a hypertext fiction game 

## ideas
> 1.	Maze
>	- Have each junction be where the player can choose a direction
>	- Some dead ends allow you to turn around
>	- Some could be a failed screen/animation?
>	- End screens could show time spent trapped in the maze
> 2.	Escape from somewhere
>	- Multiple rooms with items to pickup 
>	- Have to collect certain items to access rooms
>	- Could have certain items create noise​ to get you caught/fail
3.	RPG style game (the Bards tale/wasteland/Ultima1)
	- Small grid-based game
	- Encounters/fights on certain points
	- Win lose battles based off items found

## sprint goals
1. [x] research a background for *why* a hypertext game is important? 
2. [x] write my **project vision** for what I aim to achieve
3. [x] create user stories
4. [x] complete sprints
5. [ ] note issues/challenges likely to face
6. [x] design a prototype
7. [ ] fill out the design document template?

9. [x] product backlog (failed parts of sprints?)
