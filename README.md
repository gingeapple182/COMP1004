# COMP1004

aim to create a hypertext fiction game 

## ideas
1.	Maze
	- Have each junction be where the player can choose a direction
	- Some dead ends allow you to turn around
	- Some could be a failed screen/animation?
	- End screens could show time spent trapped in the maze
2.	Escape from somewhere
	- Multiple rooms with items to pickup 
	- Have to collect certain items to access rooms
	- Could have certain items create noise​ to get you caught/fail
3.	RPG style game (the Bards tale/wasteland/Ultima1)
	- Small coordinates-based game
	- Each point moved to could say generic compass hints
	- Encounters/fights on certain points
	- Win lose battles based off items found

## sprint goals
1. [ ] research a background for *why* a hypertext game is important? //its really not since i hadn't heard of them until this module
2. [ ] once decided on specific plan, make my **project vision** for what I aim to achieve
   - aim to complete 2 before christmas
4. [ ] reorganise and make *practical* plans for sprints
5. [ ] note issues/challenges likely to face //like the fact ive never coded html/java/css
6. [ ] design a prototype
7. [ ] fill out the design document template?
8. [ ] UML diagrams - use cases - classes? - interaction disgrams (would this be like a map of the dialogue options?
9. [ ] product backlog (failed parts of sprints?)
10. [x] sprint plans - this?

## interim video
4 minute video covering the follwoing topics regarding my project progress
* Project vision + background
* project plan and already completed sprints
* UML models
* prototype
* description of challenges/issues (dont complain about labs)

## final presentation
6 minute presentation covering the following
1. the running programme - not sure how to show fully if its meant to be a fully functioning game
2. final project plan + sprints
3. final/complexest UML diagram - wtf is a UML diagram??
4. *high level* summary of issues/challenges - steep af learning curve of making a game without being taught ANYTHING games
5. poster??
   - [ ] make 2-5 in a powerpoint

### extra stuff 
* final project plan
	- backlog
	- sprints
* UML diagrams
* This repo
  - change this to be a simpler outline of the project
* poster
  - key features of the game
  - architecture?
* reflective account of the issues/challenges
  - 500 words
