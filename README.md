# COMP1004

aim to create a hypertext fiction game 

## ideas
1. maze
   - draw out a maze and have each page being the junctions
   - dead ends to be either fails or just a way to turn around
1. escape from house
   - need to find a key/crowbar
   - could accidentally set off something noisy to get caught
1. >//idk context here
   - find parts to repair object
   - repairs done in wrong order it fails/kills you
1. non graphic based exploration
   - move around a board with loot/enemies/objective
   - aim to save princess

## sprint goals
1. [ ] research a background for *why* a hypertext game is important? //its really not since i hadn't heard of them until this module
2. [ ] once decided on specific plan, make my **project vision** for what I aim to achieve
   - aim to complete 2 before christmas
4. [ ] reorganise and make *practical* plans for sprints
5. [ ] note issues/challenges likely to face //like the fact ive never coded html/java/css
6. [ ] design a prototype
7. [ ] fill out the design document template?
8. [ ] UML diagrams - use cases - classes? - interaction disgrams (would this be like a map of the dialogue options?
9. [ ] product backlog (failed parts of sprints?)
10. [x] sprint plans - this?

## final presentation
6 minute presentation covering the following
1. the running programme - not sure how to show fully if its meant to be a fully functioning game
2. final project plan + sprints
3. final/complexest UML diagram - wtf is a UML diagram??
