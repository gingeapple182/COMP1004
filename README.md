# GRONK

My project aims to create an engaging 2D adventure game using pixel art style and web technologies. Players will explore diverse environments, interact with characters, and make choices that impact the game's narrative. Inspired by classic adventure games, the focus is on providing a fun and interactive experience for players of all ages. Through simple yet compelling gameplay mechanics, my goal is to deliver an enjoyable gaming experience that encourages exploration and fosters creativity. By balancing entertainment with accessibility, the project seeks to capture the essence of retro gaming while embracing modern design principles.

## The game
Gronk features a simple 2D pixel art style adventure game, you are tasked initially to defeat rats that are attacking your town, you may achieve this by stopping them and interacting, you may choose wether to attack them head on or find a solution more efficient in dealing with them.
Over time I aim to enhance the story through branching narrative storylines dependant on how you choose to overcome various obstacles.
A lot of emphasis during development has been on ensuring i created efficient and reuseable code, so that as the story becomes more fleshed out and complete, it is much simpler to build upon what has already been created so far. More levels will be added, more story will be created and much more.
